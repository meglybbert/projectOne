    <h4>Meg Lybbert Coulson</h4>
    
    <p>I am a VCD major with plans to graduate at the end of this school year; however, I plan on applying to the Master's program for Comunications. I would also like to apply to a few other schools that have remote Master's programs because I can't really leave the Cheney/Spokane Area I transferred here from Central Washington University last year after I married an EWU student. My favorite activities include sleeping, eating, and smacking destiny in the face. </p>
